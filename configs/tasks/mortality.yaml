# ICU mortality prediction task (after observation window)
# Predict if patient will die during the remainder of their ICU stay AFTER observation ends
#
# Timeline (with default settings):
#   |---- observation (48h) ----|-- gap (0h) --|---- prediction (until ICU discharge) ----|
#   intime                    +48h           +48h                                     outtime
#
# - Model sees: hours 0-48 of ICU stay
# - Model predicts: will patient die before ICU discharge?
# - Patients who die during observation (hours 0-48) are excluded (label=null)
