# @package encoder
# Linear Encoder Configuration
#
# The simplest possible baseline: a single linear projection from input
# features to embeddings. No attention, no hidden layers, no nonlinearities.
#
# Usage:
#   uv run python scripts/training/supervised.py model=linear
#
# Without observation mask (not recommended):
#   uv run python scripts/training/supervised.py model=linear encoder.use_observation_mask=false

name: linear

# Input/Output dimensions
d_model: 64  # Output embedding dimension
max_seq_length: 168  # Maximum sequence length in hours (7 days)

# No layers - this is a single linear projection
n_layers: 1  # Ignored, kept for config compatibility

# Regularization
dropout: 0.0  # No dropout for linear baseline

# Pooling strategy for sequence-level representation
# Options: mean | max | last | none
pooling: mean
