# Base Configuration
#
# This is the base config for shared defaults. Note that pretrain.yaml,
# finetune.yaml, and supervised.yaml each define their own top-level Hydra
# configs and do NOT inherit from this file. This config is used by other
# entry points (e.g. debug scripts) that need sensible defaults.
#
# Included sub-configs:
#   - data: Data paths, extraction settings, and loading settings (configs/data/ricu.yaml)
#   - model: Model architecture (configs/model/transformer.yaml)

defaults:
  - data: ricu
  - model: transformer
  - _self_
