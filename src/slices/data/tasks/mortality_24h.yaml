# 24-hour mortality prediction task
# Predict if patient will die within 24 hours AFTER the observation window ends
#
# Timeline (with default settings):
#   |---- observation (48h) ----|-- gap (0h) --|---- prediction (24h) ----|
#   intime                    +48h           +48h                       +72h
#
# - Model sees: hours 0-48 of ICU stay
# - Model predicts: will patient die in hours 48-72?
# - Patients who die during observation (hours 0-48) are excluded (label=null)

task_name: mortality_24h
task_type: binary

# Prediction parameters
prediction_window_hours: 24  # Predict mortality in 24h window after observation ends
observation_window_hours: 48  # Must match seq_length_hours in data config
gap_hours: 0  # No gap between observation end and prediction start
# Note: If gap_hours > 0, deaths during the gap period are excluded (label=null)
# similar to observation-period deaths, since they are ambiguous for prediction.
