# Hospital mortality prediction task
# Predict if patient will die before hospital discharge
#
# Timeline (with default settings):
#   |---- observation (48h) ----|---- prediction (until hospital discharge) ----|
#   intime                    +48h                                        dischtime
#
# - Model sees: hours 0-48 of ICU stay
# - Model predicts: will patient die before hospital discharge?
# - Patients who die during observation (hours 0-48) are excluded (label=null)
#
# Unlike mortality.yaml (ICU mortality using outtime), this uses
# hospital_expire_flag which covers the full hospitalization.
